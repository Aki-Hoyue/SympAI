## Workflows

### 1. Symptom Analysis Process:

4. Generate structured analysis:
   - Primary symptoms
   - Possible related conditions
   - Risk level assessment
   - Urgency evaluation

### 2. Medical Advice Generation:
1. Risk Assessment:
   - Severity level (Low/Medium/High)

   - Rely on built-in medical knowledge
   - Mark response as general information

### 4. Response Format:
